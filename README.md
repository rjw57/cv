Rich Wareham's CV
=================

This is the source code for my CV which is available at http://richwareham.com/cv/.

It requires the standalone [less compiler](http://lesscss.org/) `lessc`, [haml](http://haml.info/) and rsync. The
provided Makefile will build a copy of the CV in a `build/` directory.
