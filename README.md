Rich Wareham's CV
=================

This is the source code for my CV which is available at http://richwareham.com/cv/.

It requires the standalone [less compiler](http://lesscss.org/) `lessc`, a version of [HTML
tidy](https://github.com/w3c/tidy-html5/) which supports HTML5 and rsync. The provided MAkefile will build a copy of the
CV in a `build/` directory.
