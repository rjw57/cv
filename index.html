<h1>Work Interests</h1>
</div>
<div class='span9'>
<h2>Computing &amp; Software</h2>
<div class='description'>
I try to keep a broad range of technical skills up to date because, frankly, I like to play with technology
and writing software. In general I am quick to 'deep-dive' into a new field and find it easy to pick up new
programming languages and software-related skills. I find systems design extremely satisfying and am never
happier than when all of the metaphorical plates are kept spinning by a robot which I have designed. I am
particularly enthused by what has come to be called
<em>agile development.</em>
</div>
<h2>Academic</h2>
<div class='description'>
I am a signal processor by trade which means that I am particularly interested in the inferences one may
draw from data that one can observe. To this end I make heavy use of Bayesian methods such as Monte Carlo
sampling in order to find maximally likely
<em>a posteriori</em>
estimates of the true state of a system
from noisy observations of its output. My research interests are therefore wide-ranging and have wide
applicability. My recent interests have been in fields as diverse as computer vision and analysis and
inference of the dynamics of receptors on cell membranes. A

<h1>Technical Skills</h1>
</div>
<div class='span9'>
<h2>Languages and Libraries</h2>
<div class='description'>
Extensive experience with C, C++, Python and various Unix glue languages such as sed, awk, perl and ed.
Experience in writing for the Gtk+ and Qt GUI toolkits. I have written at least one non-trivial program in
order to learn languages including Scheme, Smalltalk, Ruby, Java and C#. I class myself as a competent
multi-paradigm programmer who is capable of picking up any sane house language or coding style with some
rapidity.
</div>
<h2>Web Technologies</h2>
<div class='description'>
Experience with HTML/CSS/JavaScript (including the latest HTML5 standards) over a wide variety of personal
projects including, but not limited to, this CV, an interactive Anglo-Saxon dictionary, an Old English
speech synthesiser, a client-side Google+ syndication system and webmaster for my group's website.
Developed a public-facing in-house course management system for the Department of Engineering which is used
to manage third and fourth year module choices. Experience with server-side programming languages such as
Python (WSGI), PHP, Perl (Mason) and Java servlets.
</div>
<h2>Computer Graphics</h2>
<div class='description'>
Enthusiastic student of realistic rendering techniques. Wrote an accelerated (via SSE) path-tracing
renderer for Minecraft maps. Can program using both the OpenGL 2/3 and DirectX 9/10 APIs. Real-world
experience of writing computer graphics software and GPU acceleration.
</div>
<h2>High-performance Computing</h2>
<div class='description'>
Member of the Many Core Computing Group in the University of Cambridge with a research interest in GPU
acceleration of scientific computing. As part of the LoLa project, I have ported many of our
compute-intensive algorithms to a multi-Tesla architecture and developed a computing engine allowing single
source-code compilation with CUDA and OpenMP accelerated backends. Developed a novel multi-threaded
Metropolis Hastings and Gibbs sampling algorithm to be published in a forthcoming paper.
</div>
<h2>System Administration</h2>
<div class='description'>
I've been
<em>de facto</em>
system administrator in many places of work and although I would class myself
as a knowledgeable amateur in this field I haven't as yet lost anyone's data despite many hardware failures
over the years. I have created company-critical backup and restore systems along with designing a company
source control and quality engineering work flow.

<h1>Other Skills</h1>
</div>
<div class='span9'>
<h2>Languages</h2>
<div class='description'>
I enjoy languages and can speak French to a conversational level. I am currently studying Arabic,
Anglo-Saxon and Welsh.
</div>
<h2>Driving</h2>
<div class='description'>
I have a full, clean UK driving license and have held it for more than ten years.
</div>
<h2>Design &amp; Theatre</h2>
<div class='description'>
I enjoy typographic design work and have designed many posters for theatre groups in and around Cambridge.
In addition, I have performed with many theatre groups and have taken several improvised comedy and comic
theatre shows to the Edinburgh Fringe festival. I have long ago lost any fear of public speaking.
