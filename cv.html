    <div class="description">
      Researched new algorithms for rigging and skinning 3D character models
      resulting in the publication of a fully-automated system called <em>Bone
      Glow</em>. The research involved acceleration of skinning on the GPU,
      implementation of a prototype in C++ and integration into the Blender
      rendering suite.
    </div>

    <div class="description">
      Researched applications of advanced mathematical geometry techniques for
      real-world use. Gained experience in geometric interpretation of signal
      processing techniques, knowledge of accelerated graphics APIs and
      developed new research in the fields of computational geometry,
      non-Eudlidean problem solving and fractals. Thesis title: <em>Computer
      Graphics using Conformal Geometric Algebra</em>.
    </div>

    <h1>Technical Skills</h1>

    <h2>Web-technologies</h2>
    <div class="description">
      Experience with HTML/CSS/JavaScript (including the latest HTML5 standards)
      over a wide variety of personal projects including, but not limited to,
      this CV, an interactive Anglo-Saxon dictionary, an Old English speech
      synthesiser, a client-side Google+ syndication system and webmaster for my
      group's website. Developed a public-facing in-house course management
      system for the Department of Engineering which is used to manage third and
      fourth year module choices. Experience with server-side programming
      languages such as Python (WSGI), PHP, Perl (Mason) and Java servlets.
    </div>

    <h2>Computer Graphics</h2>
    <div class="description">
      Enthusiastic student of realistic rendering techniques. Wrote an
      accelerated (via SSE) path-tracing renderer for Minecraft maps. Can
      program using both the OpenGL 2/3 and DirectX 9/10 APIs. Real-world
      experience of writing computer graphics software and GPU acceleration.
    </div>

    <h2>High-performance Computing</h2>
    <div class="description">
      Member of the Many Core Computing Group in the University of Cambridge
      with a research interest in GPU acceleration of scientific computing. As
      part of the LoLa project, I have ported many of our compute-intensive
      algorithms to a multi-Tesla architecture and developed a computing engine
      allowing single source-code compilation with CUDA and OpenMP accelerated
      backends. Developed a novel multi-threaded Metropolis Hastings and Gibbs
      sampling algorithm to be published in a forthcoming paper.
    </div>

    <h2>Languages and Libraries</h2>
    <div class="description">
      Extensive experience with C, C++, Python and various Unix glue languages
      such as sed, awk, perl and ed. Experience in writing for the Gtk+ and Qt
      GUI toolkits. I have written at least one non-trivial program in order to
      learn languages including Scheme, Smalltalk, Ruby, Java and C#. I class
      myself as a competent multi-paradigm programmer who is capable of picking
      up any sane house language or coding style with some rapidity.
    </div>

    <h2>System Administration</h2>
    <div class="description">
      I've been <em>de facto</em> system administrator in many places of work
      and although I would class myself as a knowledgeable amateur in this field
      I haven't as yet lost anyone's data despite many hardware failures over
      the years. I have created company-critical backup and restore systems
      along with designing a company source control and quality engineering
      work flow.
    </div>

    <section>
    <h1>Non-technical Skills</h1>

    <h2>Languages</h2>
    <div class="description">
      I enjoy languages and can speak French to a conversational level. I am
      currently studying Arabic, Anglo-Saxon and Welsh.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Driving</h2>
    <div class="description">
      I have a full, clean UK driving license and have held it for more than ten
      years. 
    </div>

    <h2>Design &amp; Theatre</h2>
    <div class="description">
      I enjoy typographic design work and have designed many posters for theatre
      groups in and around Cambridge. In addition, I have performed with many
      theatre groups and have taken several improvised comedy and comic theatre
      shows to the Edinburgh Fringe festival. I, therefore, have long ago lost
      any fear of public speaking.
